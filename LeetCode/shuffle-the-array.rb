# 0 will always be the index of the first element
# n will always be the index value of the second element
# 0 + 1 will always be the index of the third element
# n + 1 will always be the index value of the fourth element

# n * 2 is the length of the array (the total number of elements is n * 2)

# split the array in half??
# the value of n is always half of the array length
